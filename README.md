# sorting-algorithm-visualizer
A java program that visualizes common sorting algorithms such as bubbble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quicksort. As of v1.0, bubble sort is currently the only sorting algorithm implemented. Hence, this project is still being worked on.

## Basic controls
Click the Generate new array button in the top left corner to generate a random array.

## Modify array
You can change the size of the array by typing in an integer in the size box. You can also change the values of certain elements if desired.

## Sort!
Click on whichever sorting algorithm and watch the magic happen! (animations are smoother in real time, unlike this gif)

## Change speed
Use the scroll bar to speed up the process if needed. (It's a little finicky at the moment but will be fixed soon). Feel free to pause or skip the animation as well.
